# Strengths
## 1) Immutable file history
 Git provides hashes to users as version numbers this provides guarantee (a single hash always refers to exactly the same content so an attacker cannot change the history without being detected).
## 2) Enables the collaboration in teams 
# Weaknesses
## 1) If you do not pay attention to it, merge conflicts can occur 
## 2) Git is not designed for all data formats, these must be excluded separately
